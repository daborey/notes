Now that your device is good as new and all your apps are downloading, give your device a few days to recalibrate. Please note that recalibration can take some time and we recommend fully charging your device then letting it fully discharge a couple times before declaring the problem officially fixed or not. If the issue comes back and youâ€™ve eliminated the possibility of a software or firmware issue, then it might be time to have us send out a replacement part.
