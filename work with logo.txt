1. Logo for Web Use:

    Size:
        Square logo: 500px x 500px (ideal for website header or favicon)
        Rectangular logo: 1000px x 200px (for wider banners or header sections)
    Bit Depth:
        24-bit color depth (16.7 million colors), ideal for rich color and smooth gradients.
    File Format:
        PNG (for transparency) or JPEG (for non-transparent logos) or SVG (for scalability).
    DPI:
        DPI is not relevant for web images; however, 72 DPI or 96 DPI is the common screen resolution used.

2. Logo for Print Use:

    Size:
        Square logo: 1000px x 1000px (300 DPI for print clarity)
        Rectangular logo: 2000px x 400px (300 DPI for print clarity)
    Bit Depth:
        24-bit color depth for rich color accuracy and smooth transitions.
        Optionally, 48-bit for extremely high-end color accuracy (if needed).
    File Format:
        Vector formats (SVG, EPS, PDF) for scalability and precision.
        TIFF or PNG for raster formats.
    DPI:
        300 DPI is recommended for high-quality print results, ensuring your logo prints clearly and sharply.



Yes, the recommendations provided are for general use in both web and print and not just for Bootstrap websites. These guidelines apply to any web design or print design scenario.
For Web Use:

    The recommended sizes (500px x 500px for square, 1000px x 200px for rectangular) and 24-bit color are suitable for any website, not just Bootstrap-based sites.
        Websites: Whether you're using frameworks like Bootstrap, WordPress, custom HTML/CSS, or others, these logo sizes and bit depth will work well.
        Responsive Design: For responsive design, the image should scale well across devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops), so using formats like SVG is preferred for scalability.

For Print Use:

    The sizes (1000px x 1000px or 2000px x 400px) with 300 DPI and 24-bit color are general print standards and apply to any printed material (business cards, brochures, banners, etc.), regardless of whether it's part of a Bootstrap-designed website or any other print design project.
        Printing: When printing logos, DPI is essential, but these sizes are universal for most high-quality print projects.

Key Points:

    These guidelines are not limited to specific web technologies (like Bootstrap) and are intended for all web and print use cases.
    The goal is to ensure your logo looks good both digitally (on websites, social media, etc.) and in physical print (on brochures, business cards, etc.).
